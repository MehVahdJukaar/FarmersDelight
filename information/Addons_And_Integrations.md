# Checking Which Farmer's Delight Fabric Port You Have.
As of 1.20.1-2.0.13+refabricated, you are able to check which version of Farmer's Delight you have by utilising a version check like so.

This is the safest way to do so, because codebase changes to Refabricated or Fabric will not be affected.

You can do whatever with this, you can crash the client, you can disable/enable certain things, whatever floats your boat...
```java
public static boolean isFDRefabricated() {
    // Use Objects#equals to make sure it's null safe for Farmer's Delight Fabric, which should not contain a +.
    return FabricLoader.getInstance().getModContainer("farmersdelight").map(container -> Objects.equals(container.getMetadata().getVersion().getFriendlyString().split("\\+")[1], "refabricated")).orElse(false);
}
```

If you want to have this check in common code you can also use this alternative approach instead. Note that this will also return true when the forge mod is on.
Useful for common code uses.
```java
public static final boolean HAS_FD_FORGE_OR_REFABRICATED;
static {
    try {
        Class.forName("vectorwing.farmersdelight.FarmersDelight");
        HAS_FD_FORGE_OR_REFABRICATED = true;
    } catch (Exception ignored) {
        HAS_FD_FORGE_OR_REFABRICATED = false;
    }
}
```
