- Update mixins to allow for other modifications to placements of crops.
    - Added two tags to determine whether a crop should:
    - `farmersdelight:does_not_survive/rich_soil` Does not survive on rich soil.
        - Should contain plants considered crops, nether or water.
        - For example: Wheat, Nether Wart, Lily Pad.
    - `farmersdelight:survives/rich_soil` Survives on rich soil.
        - Should contain everything other than the above.
    - `farmersdelight:survives/rich_soil_farmland` Survives on rich soil.
        - Should contain plants considered crops or plains.
        - For example: Tomatoes, Saplings, Fern.
    - `farmersdelight:does_not_survive/rich_soil_farmland` Does not survive on rich soil farmland.
        - Should contain everything other than the above.
- The original behavior is preserved if neither tag contains the block you are trying to place.
- This should also make catching edge cases with these features easier going forth.
