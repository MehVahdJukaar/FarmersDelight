- Updated for parity with Farmer's Delight 1.2.5
- Updated built-in version of Porting Lib, hopefully fixing the issues with the libraries when nested.
- Fixed DFU acting up when upgrading a world with a Rotten Tomato in it.
- Rewrote Skillet Flipping to be bound to the Attack key rather than being hardcoded to left click.
- Fixed Farmer's Delight Dough not working with Create recipes. [#47](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelightRefabricated/issues/47).
